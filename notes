For the HW

we want things as loosely coupled as possible

The to-do list items don't know about each other or that they are even in lists
it knows what the text is and when it's done

js comment block

How to seperate it out - *TODO ITEM*
-Each item has a set of things to do to itself
	- string, done button
	- what does it need to know
		-inner html (text)
		-if it's done (boolean) when we toggle the done button it should change the boolean true and false 
	- There's also the dom manipulation of it
		-li
			-p
				-button	

OUTSIDE OF THAT
	- Whole list
	- input field
		-type in there and they click enter
			- an item gets created using the string (DOM)
	- Items themselves
		- items is an array of todo items
	- Current items counter and how many are done counter
		- check how many items are in the array

SO

TodoList will be a class
and 
TodoItem will be a class



User clicks the DOM button
	THEN
	-the boolean changes states
	-it needs to change the class so that other ppl can use it but we don't want it to just be used and stuff
		- we are going to dispatch an event. We can have the dom item just say out loud "HEY something changed."

		- then we'll have the todoList listening out for that should said and be ready to do something with it

		- the item needs to just output communication and not have anything dependent on it. 

then we'll have an update view and it's going to have logic to rearrange from the top down

FOR WEEK ONE write all the todo item stuff
create elements for that to be able to show up and append it
